The Quran is divided into one hundred and fourteen sections. Each such divided section is a Surah. The division and naming of Surahs is divine. The main theme of each Surah will be a part of the original subject of the Quran or any subject related to it."},{category:"Revelation:",description:"After receiving prophethood, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) lived in Makkah for about thirteen years and in Madinah for about ten years. The Surahs revealed during his stay in Makkah are called Makki Surahs and those revealed after migration to Madinah are called Madani Surahs. The place of revelation of each Surah is shown at the beginning of the respective Surahs in this translation."}],n=[{category:"Section:",description:"For ease of recitation, the Quran is divided into thirty Juz' (parts). Each Juz' is divided into several Ruku's. The number of Ruku's contained in each chapter is shown as a section at the beginning of the chapter."},{category:"Verse:",description:"What is called 'Ayat' in technical language is translated as verse. Ayat are the individual sentences in the Surah. The scope of the verses is determined by Allah. In the Arabic original, the verses in each Surah are separated by adding serial numbers in between. In the Malayalam translation, the verses are not separated individually. The serial number of the verses contained in each section is given at its beginning. If there is a '-' mark before or after the verse number, it means that the translation of that verse is not complete in the given section. Example: 15-17- indicates that the translation of verse 17 is only partially included in this section. When shown as -17-22, it means that the translation of verse 17 is partially included in the previous section."}],i=[{symbol:"ج",meaning:"Pause is preferred"},{symbol:"ز",meaning:"Pause is prohibited"},{symbol:"ص",meaning:"Pause is mandatory"},{symbol:"ق",meaning:"Pause and continuation are equal"},{symbol:"",meaning:"Pause at one of two places only"},{symbol:"لا",meaning:"Pause is optional but continuation is preferred"},{symbol:"ل",meaning:"Isolated letter should not be pronounced"},{symbol:"",meaning:"Letter should not be pronounced when joined"},{symbol:"",meaning:"Closed vowel sound"},{symbol:"م",meaning:"Pronounced between and based on closed Meem"},{symbol:"ن",meaning:"Pronounce Tanween clearly"},{symbol:"",meaning:"Tanween should be merged or hidden"},{symbol:"ل",meaning:"Must pronounce the omitted letter"},{symbol:"عه",meaning:"Must pronounce liquid as 'Seen'.
