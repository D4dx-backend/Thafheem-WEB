        When so many translations of, and commentaries on, the Holy Qur'an
        already exist, a desire for spiritual blessing and grace is not in
        itself sufficient justification for undertaking a fresh venture in this
        field. The effort will only be worthwhile if it fills gaps left by
        earlier works, or satisfies some unmet need felt by those interested in
        studying the Holy Book.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The present work is neither directed at scholars and researchers, nor is
        it aimed at assisting those who, having mastered the Arabic language and
        the Islamic religious sciences, now wish to embark upon a thorough and
        elaborate study of the Qur'ãn. Such people already have plenty of
        material at their disposal. Instead it is intended for the lay reader,
        the average educated person, who is not well-versed in Arabic and so is
        unable to make full use of the vast treasures to be found in classical
        works on the Qur'an. For this reason many subjects prominent in the more
        technical works of Qur'anic exegesis have not been treated. The
        principal aims throughout have been to help the reader to acquire a
        clear grasp of the Qur'ãn, to clarify ambiguities which he may encounter
        in his study, and to solve problems which may arise in his mind. It is
        for the reader to judge how far these aims have been achieved. Literal
        translation has been abandoned in favour of a relatively free
        interpretative rendering of the Qur'ãn. This does not imply any
        objection to literal translation as such. Several distinguished scholars
        have already used this approach admirably. For example, the translation
        of Shah Wall Allah in Persian and the translations of Shah 'Abd
        al-Qadir, Shah RafT' al-Din, Mawlãnã MahmUd al-Hasan, Mawlãna Ashraf
        'All and Hãfiz Fath Muhammad Jãlandhari in Urdu. For this reason little
        useful remains to be done in this sphere. There are, however, certain
        needs which are not, and cannot, be met by a literal translation and it
        is to these that this work seeks to respond. Literal translations of the
        Qur'an tend inevitably to lack literary force, fluency, eloquence and
        stylistic charm. Such lifelessness is incapable of either arousing the
        reader to ecstasy, stirring his being, making his eyes flow with tears,
        or raising a storm of emotion within his soul. Literal translations
        often leave one doubting whether the original book could indeed have
        been that which challenged the whole world to produce another like it.
        What filters through is merely the dry husk of its contents, stripped of
        all literary enchantm ent. The violent, soul-shaking spirit which
        permeates the original text is thus evaporated into thin air. This is a
        serious drawback, for the literary force of the Our'an plays possibly as
        important a role in conveying its message as the teachings themselves.
        It was the literary quality of the Our'ãn — a quality acknowledged even
        by its opponents — which first melted the hearts of its opponents, and
        shook the length and breadth of Arabia like a thunderbolt.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Another reason why literal translations fail to inspire the reader is
        the manner is which they are set for printing. Either the interlinear
        style is followed or, according to a more recent fashion, a page is
        bisected and the Quranic text is printed on one half of the page, with
        the translation on the other half. This practice certainly has its uses,
        but jts drawback is that the reader, being unable to read passages with
        continuity, often fails to receive their full impact as chunks of Arabic
        constantly interrupt the flow of his reading. Most English translations
        of the Qur'an make particularly lifeless reading because, following the
        Biblical pattern, the translation of each verse is numbered, and begins
        on a new line. Take any piece of great literature, break it into
        fragments, put one sentence over another, give each one a number, and
        then try to read it. It will soon become obvious that the impact is
        nothing like that created by reading a coherent and continuous text.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Again, an orator may often switch from one grammatical person to
        another, while referring both to himself and to his audience. He will
        sometimes mention his audience in the third person, while at other times
        address them directly in the second. He may similarly alternate between
        the singular and the plural. He will sometimes speak on his own behalf,
        and sometimes on behalf of a group of people. At other times he will
        speak as if representing some power on high, and on yet other occasions
        that power will speak through his tongue. This undoubtedly makes speech
        more effective, but when that speech appears in book form, an element of
        incoherence is bound to be noticeable; the farther one is removed from
        the original context and environment the greater the sense of
        incoherence. This explains why people who do not fully appreciate this
        fact and, despite their knowledge of Arabic, complain of a lack of
        coherence between various parts of the Qur'an. Since the Qur'an is
        literally the Word of God, it would obviously be sacrilegious to add a
        single syllable to the original text, even with the intention of
        enabling the reader to have a better perception of its inner coherence.
        Hence the only service that Qur'anic scholars can render to
        Arabic-knowing readers is to provide explanatory notes wherever needed.
        However, when we attempt to convey the meaning of the Qur'an in another
        language, it seems justifiable to take a little liberty — though
        exercising the utmost care and circumspection — and replace the oral by
        the written style, thereby easing the problem of those who have
        difficulty in perceiving its inner coherence.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A further important reason why literal translations of the Qur'an tend
        to be ineffective is that the Qur'anic style is oratorical rather than
        narrative. If the translator retains the original oratorical style,
        rather than replacing it with straightforward prose, passages are bound
        to appear somewhat incoherent. It is well known that the Qur'ãn was not
        originally revealed as a set of written treatises. What actually
        happened was that various discourses were revealed to the Prophet (peace
        be on him) in the context of the circumstances and problems which he
        encountered in the course of his mission, and these he delivered to the
        people in spoken form. Oral language and style naturally differ greatly
        from written composition. For example, suppose a person were to write
        something to clarify a misunderstanding. He would first have to refer
        explicitly to the misunderstanding, then say things which might clarify
        it. But a man delivering a speech for the purpose of clarifying that
        same misunderstanding would not need to make specific reference to it,
        for his audience would consist largely of the very people concerned.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As already pointed out, every sürah of the Qur'an is in fact a segment
        of speech, revealed at a certain stage of the Islamic movement. Each
        revelation was occasioned by the demands of certain circumstances, and
        had certain purposes to fulfil. Every surãh is so vitally linked with
        its situational background and its circumstant ial setting that anyone
        reading a mere verbal translation, divorced from its context, would fail
        to appreciate many of the points being made. It therefore also seems
        reasonable to occasionally add a few words in such a way that the
        translated text reflects the situational context, even if only to a very
        limited extent, and thus renders the passages more comprehensive and
        more meaningful to the reader.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A final problem with literal translations is that even though the Qur'ãn
        was revealed in 'clear Arabic' (Qur'an 6: 2), it also has its own
        special terminology. It often uses words with meanings other than their
        literal ones and this in itself may give rise to many ambiguities. Take,
        for instance, the word 'kufr', which in the Qur'Anic usage has a
        different meaning not only from its ordinary Arabic linguistic usage,
        but also from its terminological connotation in the works of later
        theologians and jurists, in addition the word is not used uniformly in
        the same sense throughout the Qur'an. Sometimes it denotes a state of
        absolute lack of faith and sometimes it signifies merely rejection or
        denial. At other times, it is used for an attitude of ingratitude and
        thanklessness. It is aLso used to denote non-fulfilment of certain
        requirements of faith. Yet again, it is used in the sense that, despite
        the profession of faith, a person's life at a practical level
        essentially exhibits rejection and disobedience. The same word is
        further used to signify external obedience unaccomp anied by true,
        inner, conviction. If we were invariably to use the word 'kufr' in a
        language such as Urdu. In which it is currently in use, or its
        equivalent in other languages, the translation would doubtless be
        correct, but it might fail to convey the full import of the original; it
        might even give a wrong impression, or create unnecessary confusion in
        the mind of the reader.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Consideration of these shortcomings has led me to attempt what I would
        prefer to call an explanatory or interpretative exposition, rather than
        a literal translation. In other words, I have not tried to render the
        Arabic text of the Qur'an into another language. Instead I have tried to
        express in my own words, and as faithfully as possible, the meaning
        conveyed to me by the Qur'anic passages and the impression they make
        upon me. As far as the form of the work is concerned, I have tried to
        ensure that this translation does not make dull reading or lack literary
        elegance and that it reflects something of the force and candour of the
        'clear Arabic' of the Qur'án. I have also tried to help the reader to
        appreciate the natural continuity of the various parts of the Qur'anic
        sürahs, so that as well as embodying the meaning and purport of the Word
        of God, this work also mirrors something of its majestic grandeur and
        literary brilliance. I have prefaced every sürah with careful notes on
        the period of a particular revelation, the circumstances obtaining at
        the time, the stage through which the Islamic movement was then passing,
        and its chief needs and problems. Moreover, wherever specific background
        information is relevant to the understanding of a particular verse or
        group of verses, such information is supplied in the explanatory notes.
        In the explanatory notes, every effort has been made to avoid
        distracting the reader's attention from the Qur'än itself. These notes
        have a two-fold purpose: first, to elucidate and clarify and, second, to
        highlight the spirit and aim of the Qur'anic passages. The reader is
        advised to go through the introductory sections of each sürah before
        beginning to study the sürah itself, and to refer back to them eyen
        during his study.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Muslim readers are further advised to go through whatever portion of the
        Qur'an they usually recite each day, along with any literal translation
        of its meaning, then to read our interpretative rendering of the same
        passage without reference to the notes, focusing on the passage as a
        whole. Only then should they proceed to study it verse by verse, reading
        the explanatory notes as well for a more thorough understanding. It is
        hoped that such study will enable the ordinary reader — God willing — to
        acquire a considerable, if not scholarly, understanding of the Qur'an.

        This work was begun in Muharram, 1361 A.H./February, 1942. The work
        continued for just over five years, during which time interpretative
        rendering and explanatory notes were completed up to Sürah 12. Then
        several events, occurring in quick succession, not only prevented me
        from proceeding with the work, but even from revising what had been thus
        far accomplished. In October, 1948, by a stroke of luck, good or bad, I
        was arrested under the Public Safety Act and imprisoned. I was thus able
        to find the time needed to prepare this work for the press. I now pray
        to Allah that He may fulfil the purpose for which this work was
        undertaken, and make it useful for developing a better and fuller
        understanding of the Holy Qu r'ãn.
