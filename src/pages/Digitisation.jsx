        Development and growth in technology has effected inevitable changes in
        human habits. Our reading habits have shifted from pages to screens of
        computer and smart phone. The new generation gives prominence to visuals
        and audios than to scripts. Apprehending the trend, the latest edition,
        with prominence to audio, of Thafheemul Quran, the famous exegesis of
        Quran authored by Sayyid Abul Aâ€™la Maududi, is being released by D4
        Media.

        The first edition of Thafheemul Quran had garnered wide acceptance among
        Keralites living in Kerala and abroad since its launch in 2008. The new
        version is conceived for MS Windows, Linux and Mac Operating system. The
        web edition and mobile versions including android will follow the launch
        of the launch of this edition.

        This second edition of Thafheemul Quran is a result of priceless efforts
        put in by a team comprising scholars and talented technicians. May Allah
        accept this effort and reward us duly. Ameen!
