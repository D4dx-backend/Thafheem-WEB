              Ever since its completion in 1972, Tafheemul quran has been
              translated into many international languages. In the English
              language, translation of Tafhim was undertaken twice. It was first
              translated by Late Chaudhry Muhammad Akbar of Sialkot in whose
              house Maulana Maududi used to stay whenever he visited Dr. Iqbal's
              home town. His translation was in 5 volumes, last of which was
              rendered into English by his associate Abdul Aziz Kamal. Chaudhry
              Muhammad Akbar's translation ends at chapter Al-Hajj but was
              edited and made ready for publication by Mr. A.A Kamal M.A.
              Despite their pioneering efforts it was felt that their
              translations were not up to the desired standards. Hence it was
              decided with the concurrence of Maulana himself to ask Dr. Zafar
              Ishaq Ansari to undertake a new translation which he had finished
              up to chapter Al-Nur (as published by MMI, New Delhi). However Dr.
              Ansari has not only completed the translation of the whole of the
              Arabic text up to the end but has also revised his own translation
              done up to the chapter Al-Nur making necessary corrections,
              amendments and improvements as stated by him in his preface to the
              one-volume abridged edition. He also translated The Introduction
              of the Tafseer written by Syed Abul Aala Maududi in Urdu into
              English. While the translation of the Qur'anic text is entirely Dr
              Ansari's effort,(in Towards Understanding the Quran), He has been
              ably assisted in the explanatory notes by Dr A R Kidwai of the
              Islamic Foundation.
